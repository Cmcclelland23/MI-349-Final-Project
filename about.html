    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>I've always been fascinated by technology and how it works. As I get older, I developer and learn more everyday involving multimedia game and web design, digital content creation, and social media management. With growing hands-on experience at Simcoach Games and in corporate events at MediaQuest, I'm eager to continue to apply my skills and flourish in the tech and design industry</p>
